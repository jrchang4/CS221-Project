# CS221-Project
Stock Portfolio Optimization

The goal of this project is to create an optimized stock portfolio that optimizes returns based on an acceptable amount of risk.  
The Risk Score can be calculated using a combination of the ve principal risk measures in the
market: alpha, which measures risk relative to the market; beta, which measures the volatility of
a a fund in comparison to the market; R-squared, which measures the percentage of an
investment's movement that is attributable to movements in its benchmark index; Standard
Deviation, which is a method of measuring data dispersion in regards to the mean value of the
dataset; and Sharpe Ratio, which measures performance as adjusted by the associated risks.
